📊 Project Overview
This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard that visualizes and analyzes key data related to electric vehicles (EVs). The dashboard provides insights into EV sales, performance metrics, regional distribution, charging infrastructure, and other critical parameters influencing adoption and trends.

🚀 Features
Dynamic Visualizations: Interactive charts, maps, and slicers to explore EV data.

Sales Analysis: Year-wise and model-wise EV sales trends.

Battery and Performance Metrics: Analysis of battery range, efficiency, and charging times.

Geographical Distribution: Maps showing EV density across different regions/states.

Charging Infrastructure: Number of stations, types of chargers, and accessibility.

Filterable Insights: User-friendly slicers for brand, year, location, and more.

📁 Files
Electric vehicle.pbix: Power BI file containing the full dashboard, visualizations, data model, and measures.
